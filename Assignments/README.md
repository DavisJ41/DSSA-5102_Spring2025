# Assignment 3: Data Gathering and Warehousing

This data was obtained through Kaggle. The author of this data is Utsav Dey. 

A downloadable link for this data can be obtained here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utsavdey1410/food-nutrition-dataset/data .

Sources the author used to collect this data came from: https://www.yazio.com/en/foods .

Juypter Notebook was used to clean the data. 

While cleaning the data, I have removed the first two columns, because these columns were index columns that served no purpose.

All column names were changed to lower case.

All columns names were combined to remove spaces.

All food were also organized in alphebetical order.

In addition, it was checked to see if there was any NA values.

No values were ommitted in this dataset. 

The units of the numeric values are: Caloric Value (kcal per 100 grams), Fat (g), Saturated Fats (g), Monounsaturated Fats (g), 
Polyunsaturated Fats (g), Carbohydrates (g), Sugars (g), Protein (g), Dietary Fiver (g), Cholesterol (mg), Sodium (g), Water (g), 
Vitamin A (mg), Vitamin B1 (mg), Vitamin B11 (mg), Vitamin B12 (mg), Vitamin B2 (mg), Vitamin B3 (mg), Vitamin B5 (mg), Vitamin B6 (mg), 
Vitamin C (mg), Vitamin D (mg), Vitamin E (mg), Vitamin K (mg), Calcium (mg), Copper (mg), Iron (mg), Magnesium (mg), Manganese (mg), 
Phosphorus (mg), Potassium (mg), Selenium (mg), Zinc (mg).

The webiste the data was obtained from, YAZIO, verifies food entries by reviewing them manually and using trusted sources.
It is said in the description that the data set is expected to update monthly.

Definitions for each column name:
Food: The name or type of the food item.
Caloric Value: Total energy provided by the food.
Fat: Total amount of fats in grams per 100 grams, including the breakdowns that follow.
Saturated Fats: Amount of saturated fats (fats that typically raise the level of cholesterol in the blood).
Monounsaturated Fats: Amount of monounsaturated fats (considered heart-healthy fats).
Polyunsaturated Fats: Amount of polyunsaturated fats (include essential fats your body needs but can't produce itself).
Carbohydrates: Total carbohydrates in grams per 100 grams, including sugars.
Sugars: Total sugars in grams per 100 grams, a subset of carbohydrates.
Protein: Total proteins in grams per 100 grams, essential for body repair and growth.
Dietary Fiber: Fiber content in grams per 100 grams, important for digestive health.
Cholesterol: Cholesterol content in milligrams per 100 grams, pertinent for cardiovascular health.
Sodium: Sodium content in milligrams per 100 grams, crucial for fluid balance and nerve function.
Water: Water content in grams per 100 grams, which affects the foodâ€™s energy density.
Vitamin A: Important for vision and immune functioning.
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): Essential for glucose metabolism.
Vitamin B11 (Folic Acid): Crucial for cell function and tissue growth, particularly important in pregnancy.
Vitamin B12: Important for brain function and blood formation.
Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Necessary for energy production, cell function, and fat metabolism.
Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Supports digestive system, skin, and nerves health.
Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid): Necessary for making blood cells, and helps convert food into energy.
Vitamin B6: Important for normal brain development and keeping the nervous and immune systems healthy.
Vitamin C: Important for the repair of all body tissues.
Vitamin D: Crucial for the absorption of calcium, promoting bone growth and health.
Vitamin E: Acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals.
Vitamin K: Necessary for blood clotting and bone health.
Calcium: Vital for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth.
Copper: Helps with the formation of collagen, increases the absorption of iron and plays a role in energy production.
Iron: Essential for the creation of red blood cells.
Magnesium: Important for many processes in the body including regulation of muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, and DNA.
Manganese: Involved in the formation of bones, blood clotting factors, and enzymes that play a role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption, and blood sugar regulation.
Phosphorus: Helps with the formation of bones and teeth and is necessary for the body to make protein for the growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and tissues.
Potassium: Helps regulate fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve signals.
Selenium: Important for reproduction, thyroid gland function, DNA production, and protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals and from infection.
Zinc: Necessary for the immune system to properly function and plays a role in cell division, cell growth, wound healing, and the breakdown of carbohydrates.
Nutrition Density: A metric indicating the nutrient richness of the food per calorie.
Each of these columns provides critical data that can help in understanding the nutritional content of various foods, supporting a wide range of dietary, health, and medical research applications.

All definitions were obtained from the column descriptions from Kaggle under the link for the downloadable data.

This data is licenced as a public domain and is free to use.
